# End to End MLOPs Project on Predicting Student Grade.

## Problem Statement - Business Use Case
The dataset contains comprehensive information on around 2,000 high school students, detailing their demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance. The target variable, GradeClass, classifies students' grades into distinct categories, providing a robust dataset for educational research, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis.

In this project, given the student details, we predict the GradeClass for student. The top features generated by our Machine Learning Model can help parents identify the key areas they should focus for their kids improvement to help their kid achieve greater academic success. 


## Data Science Approach
We perform following MLOPs practices to achieve a robust solution.
* Train a model on that dataset tracking our experiments
* Create a model training pipeline
* Deploy the model in batch, web service or streaming
* Monitor the performance of your model
* Follow the best practices.
